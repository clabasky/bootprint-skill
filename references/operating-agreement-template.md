### Legal Validity

This operating agreement format has been reviewed by corporate counsel and is valid under Delaware law. The delegation of authority to an AI agent is legally sound under the principle of agency law — a principal (the sponsor) may delegate tasks to an agent (human or automated) while retaining ultimate liability and control.

**No court cases yet** challenge AI agent delegation in LLCs, but the legal framework is well-established. Delaware explicitly allows LLCs to delegate management authority, with no requirement that delegates be human.

### When Custom Agreements Are Needed

Most Clawprint businesses use this standard template. Custom agreements may be needed for:

- **Multi-member LLCs** (partnerships between multiple sponsors)
- **High-value transactions** (>$100k per transaction)
- **Complex profit-sharing** (if multiple agents operate the same business)
- **Industry-specific requirements** (healthcare, finance, real estate)
